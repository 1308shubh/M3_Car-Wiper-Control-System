Car Wiper Control System

A wiper drive and two wiper arms make up a windshield wiper system. The drive pushes the two wiper arms over the windshield at an angle that allows the driver and passenger to see clearly. A carefully contoured rubber wiping lip gives the best possible wipe.
The wiper arm has spray nozzles incorporated into it, which increases cleaning effectiveness, expands the field of vision, and allows for a good perspective. There is no vast spray mist created, unlike traditional methods. Even at faster speeds, vision is substantially improved.
A rear wiper system consists of a single wiper arm and a rear wiper drive. The system may be installed on either the top or bottom of the back window.
