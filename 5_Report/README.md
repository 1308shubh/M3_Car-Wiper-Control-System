Topic - Car Wiper Control System

A wiper is used to clean car glass that has been exposed to dirt or moisture. Wipers are usually mounted to the front and back of the vehicle. The driver's view will not be obstructed by the wiper, allowing them to see clearly to the front and rear.
Because wiper performance is strongly tied to driving safety, wipers play a critical role in the safety of riders. The windshield will be dewy if it rains a lot and the automobile doesn't utilise wipers. The driver's visibility will be obstructed by visible dew on the glass.
When a driver's perspective is obstructed, the likelihood of an accident increases dramatically. As a result, wipers are an essential automotive feature that must be included on all cars.
