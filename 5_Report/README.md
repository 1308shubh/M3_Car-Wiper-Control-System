Topic - Car Wiper Control System

A wiper is used to clean car glass that has been exposed to dirt or moisture. Wipers are usually mounted to the front and back of the vehicle. The driver's view will not be obstructed by the wiper, allowing them to see clearly to the front and rear.
Because wiper performance is strongly tied to driving safety, wipers play a critical role in the safety of riders. The windshield will be dewy if it rains a lot and the automobile doesn't utilise wipers. The driver's visibility will be obstructed by visible dew on the glass.
When a driver's perspective is obstructed, the likelihood of an accident increases dramatically. As a result, wipers are an essential automotive feature that must be included on all cars.

Car Wiper Components -
1.Wiper Motor.
2.Wiper Link.
3.Wiper Arm.
4.Wiper Blade.
5.Wiper Linkage.

The requirements for this model is -
We must have installed STM32 & QEMU for working on this project.
The components which are used in this model is STM32F407VG Microcontroller Board ( Upto 1Mbyte of Flash Memory ).

Working Principle - 
Assume the microcontroller is the vehicle. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) turns on, the wiper starts, and the second led (blue) turns on at the appropriate pace. The third led (green) will turn on if the button is pressed again, and the wiper speed will be increased in contrast to the previous one. The fourth press will activate the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in line with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.
